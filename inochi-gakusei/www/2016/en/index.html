    			The top cause of deaths around the world is ischemic heart disease.</br>
				Every 1 minute, it kills <strong>14</strong> people in the the world.</br>
				Also, in Japan, it is increasingly drawing attention as Japan enters an aging society.</br>
				About <strong>40,000</strong> people are died because of this disease.</br>
				Thanks to the government, AED（Automated External Defibrillator）, </br>
				a medical device used for electroshock therapy </br>
				which can help return the state of the heart back to normal, </br>
				is known to everybody and placed like everywhere（about 450,000 in number）, but….</br>
				It is only being used for <strong>3.7%</strong> of the people 
				who have experienced a sudden heart attack and have collapsed outside.</br>
				Splendid technology cannot elicit its effect unless it is used.</br>
				Or, maybe much better technology and much better solutions are hidden in the world?</br></br>

				Aging population and low utility rate of the available technology are problems</br>
				that not only affect modern Japan, </br>
				but also almost every other country in the predictable future. </br>
				So, how about we coorperate to look for the solution,</br>
				and be prepared for the problems that may come upon us?</br></br>

				Everyday, lives that should have been saved are being sacrificed.</br>
				To save a life we could not save yesterday,</br>
				Will you join us to think about the solution?</br></br>

		    			<p>Making Kansai an international hub for medical care.</br>
						I am a heart surgeon that was born, raised, and studied in Osaka.</br>
						Using regenerative medicine based methods, I treat patients who suffer from heart disease.</br>
						I am confident that Kansai, which has been selected as a national strategic economic zone, has the substantial medical technology, research and facilities, which make it suitable as a future medical care health city. </br>
						We should also consider, that it is the power of the youth that will be essential in keeping the medical care in Kansai continuously progressing in 10 years time.</br>
						I strongly believe that a project such as this, which allows young people to create innovation in the medical world, is an ideal opportunity for those who aim to be true medical professionals, to reexamine their own aspirations and acquire the power to change the world. </br>
						I hope that through this inochi student forum, you will all become leaders who transform the future of medical care in Kansai.  </p>
